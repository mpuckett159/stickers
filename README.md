## My Body Is A Witch

The source of this one is complicated but basically the line was taken from the poem Anorexic by Eavan Boland. I first heard this stanza from the song The Heretic by The Sound of Animals Fighting, which was referencing that poem, but I heard it completely devoid of context and it became a mantra of transformation for me instead of a meditation on disordered eating, something I've also struggled with. Anyway.
